### Project Overview 

In this project, you'll make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. 

 for this project, the idea is to focus on some key things that we need if want to make a working game:
    - The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
    - Something different happens depending on the choice the player made. 
    - The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time
    - The game has conditions for winning and losing.
    - When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
